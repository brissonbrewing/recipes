Beer 'n Brat Pasta
<p>
serves 2-4
<p>
Ingredients:
<br>olive oil
<br>one package (5 links) johnsonville bratwurst
<br>one medium-bodied, low-hop beer (like Yuengling)
<br>4 medium onions, diced
<br>6 cloves garlic, minced
<br>one can (14.5 ounce) petite diced tomatoes, or  about a cup of freshly diced tomatoes
<br>good parmesean cheese, shredded
<br>One box pasta...bowties work well, but any bite-sized shape will do
<p>
In a large frying or chef pan, brown the brats on both sides with olive oil.  Add the beer, cover, and turn temperature to low.  Simmer for 4-5 minutes, turn brats, re-cover, and simmer for another 4-5 minutes.  Remove the lid and raise the tenperature to medium, allowing the beer to cook down into a syrup.  When the beer just starts to burn, add all of the onions.  It may look like there are way too many onions, but I promise they will cook down.  
<p>Add salt to the onions, and toss/stir/flip them often.  You may want to add more olive oil for this.  Flip the brats once they've browned again, and remove them once both sides are re-browned.  Let the brats cool on a cutting board.  
<p>Cook the onions until they are reduced by 1/3, stirring frequently.  If they start to burn, you can add a few ounces of beer to deglaze the pan.  When cooked down, add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.  Add the can of tomatoes (do not drain).  Slice the brats into moons or half moons and re-add to the pan.  
<p>Cook for about 2 more minutes, then turn off.  Add the pasta, and a quarter to half a cup of shredded parmesean cheese.  Toss to coat.  
<p>Serve with a bit more cheese on top...and then die of yummy happiness.
